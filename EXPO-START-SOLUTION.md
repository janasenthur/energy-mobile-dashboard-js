# üîß Expo Start Error - Solution Guide

## Issue Identified
The main issue was **PowerShell Execution Policy** preventing npm/npx commands from running.

## ‚úÖ Solutions

### Option 1: Use Batch File (Recommended)
Use the provided batch files that bypass PowerShell restrictions:

```bash
# Double-click or run from cmd:
expo-diagnostic.bat
# or
start-expo.bat
```

### Option 2: PowerShell with Bypass Policy
```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File start-expo-bypass.ps1
```

### Option 3: Command Prompt
Open **Command Prompt (cmd)** instead of PowerShell:
```cmd
cd "d:\Source\AI Coding\New folder\energy-mobile-dashboard-js"
npx expo start
```

### Option 4: Change PowerShell Policy (Admin Required)
If you have admin rights, you can permanently change the policy:
```powershell
# Run as Administrator
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope LocalMachine
```

## üöÄ Quick Start Commands

### If Expo Starts Successfully:
1. ‚úÖ Expo Metro bundler will show QR code
2. ‚úÖ Install **Expo Go** app on your phone
3. ‚úÖ Scan QR code to test on device
4. ‚úÖ Or press `w` to open web version

### If You See SDK Version Errors:
The project is on SDK 49, but Expo Go might require SDK 53. Use:
```cmd
npx expo install --fix
# or run the SDK upgrade script:
fix-expo.bat
```

## üîç Status Check

Based on the output we saw:
- ‚úÖ Node.js: Working (v24.3.0)
- ‚úÖ npm: Working (11.4.2)  
- ‚úÖ Expo CLI: Starting successfully
- ‚úÖ Metro Bundler: Started
- ‚úÖ Environment: Loading .env variables

## üì± Next Steps

1. **Let Expo finish starting** (takes 30-60 seconds first time)
2. **Look for QR code** in terminal output
3. **Install Expo Go** on your phone from App Store/Play Store
4. **Scan QR code** to test the app
5. **Check for any compilation errors** in the Metro bundler output

## üêõ Common Additional Issues

If you see other errors after Expo starts:

### Missing Dependencies:
```cmd
npm install
```

### SDK Compatibility:
```cmd
npx expo install --fix
```

### Cache Issues:
```cmd
npx expo start --clear
```

### Port Issues:
```cmd
npx expo start --port 19001
```
